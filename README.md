While my code might not be perfect, it serves its purpose effectively.

Here's a breakdown of the components:

- Main.py: This is the SMTP server module.
- api.js: This module serves as the bridge between the SMTP server and your PC.
- bot.js: Using Puppeteer automation, this module interacts with ![Vyper][https://vyper.io/] website.

I have set up the Main.py and api.js on an Azure Virtual Machine running Ubuntu, while bot.js runs locally on my system.
